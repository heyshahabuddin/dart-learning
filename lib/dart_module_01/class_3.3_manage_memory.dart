/*
 Dart employs automatic memory management through a generational garbage collector(GC), which handles the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects. While developers do not directly manage memory like in languages with manual memory management, understanding and optimizing memory usage is crucial for performance and preventing memory leaks.

  * Key aspects of memory management in Dart:
    >>> Garbage Collection(GC): The Dart Virtual Machine (VM) utilizes a generational garbage collector. This collector efficiently reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced by the application. This GC operates in the background, identifying and freeing up memory occupied by "unreachable" objects. It divides memory into "young" and "old" generations, optimizing the collection process for both short-lived and long-lived objects.

    >>> Heap and Stack Memory: Dart applications use both heap and stack memory. Stack memory is used for local variables and function call information, with memory automatically freed when a function completes. Heap memory is used for dynamically allocated objects, and its management is handled by the garbage collector.
        # Heap: Dynamically allocated objects (e.g., instances of classes) reside in the heap. The Dart VM manages the heap, allocating memory when objects are created and deallocating it when they are no longer needed.
        # Stack: Local variables and function call information are stored on the stack, which is used for temporary data during function execution.

    >>> Generational GC: Dart's GC is generational, dividing memory into:
        # Young Generation: Stores newly created objects and is frequently scanned for unreferenced objects.
        # Old Generation: Contains objects that have survived multiple young generation collections, indicating they are likely long-lived. This generation is scanned less frequently.

    >>> Preventing Memory Leaks: Although automatic, memory leaks can still occur if references to unused objects are unintentionally maintained, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming their memory. Common scenarios include:
        # Failing to dispose of controllers (e.g., TextEditingController, StreamController) in StatefulWidgets.
        # Retaining large objects in caches or data structures without clearing them when no longer needed.
        # Improperly managing resources in Dart FFI (Foreign Function Interface) when interacting with C code.

    >>> Minimizing Memory Leaks: While automatic, developers can still inadvertently create memory leaks by holding onto references to objects that are no longer actively used. Best practices to mitigate this include:
        # Disposing of controllers, streams, and other resources when they are no longer needed (e.g., in dispose() methods of StatefulWidgets).
        # Avoiding unnecessary retention of large objects.
        # Using const constructors where applicable to prevent redundant object creation.

    >>> Optimization Techniques:
        # Minimize Object Creation: Reduce the creation of unnecessary objects, especially within frequently called functions or loops.
        # Use const and final: Utilize const constructors for immutable objects to promote compile-time constants and prevent unnecessary rebuilds in Flutter. Use final for variables that are assigned once.
        # Dispose of Resources: Explicitly close or dispose of resources like file handles, network connections, and stream subscriptions when they are no longer required.
        # Efficient Data Structures: Select data structures that are memory-efficient for the specific task at hand.
        # Profile Memory Usage: Use tools like Dart DevTools, particularly the Memory tab and Heap Snapshot, to monitor memory usage, identify allocation hotspots, and detect potential memory leaks.

    >>> Tools for Analysis: Dart DevTools, particularly the Memory Profiler, can be used to monitor memory usage and identify potential memory leaks or excessive heap usage in Dart applications.
