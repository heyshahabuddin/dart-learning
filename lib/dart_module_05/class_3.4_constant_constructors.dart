/*
  * In Dart, a const constructor is a special type of constructor that allows to create compile-time constant instances(objects) of a class. This means that the values of the objects are known at compile time, not when the program is run and cannot be changed after the object is created. This optimizes memory usage and ensures immutability, which can improve performance.

  * Key characteristics and implications of const constructors:
    >>> Immutability: Classes with const constructors are typically designed to be immutable. Also, objects created with a const constructor are immutable. All fields within the class must be final, ensuring their values cannot change after the object is created.
    >>> Compile-time constants: All values used to initialize fields in the const constructor's initializer list must also be compile-time constants. Instances created using a const constructor are compile-time constants. This offers performance benefits as the Dart VM can reuse the same object instance if multiple const instances are created with identical values, leading to memory optimization and faster execution.
    >>> Syntax: A const constructor is defined using the const keyword before the constructor name. For example, `const MyClass(this.property);.
    >>> Instance creation: When creating an instance of a class with a const constructor, you also use the const keyword. For example, `const myObject = MyClass(value);.
    >>> No body: A const constructor cannot have a body. It only consists of an initializer list.
    >>> Compile-time constants in initializer list:
    >>> Canonicalization: When create multiple const instances with the same values, Dart will "canonicalize" them, meaning it will reuse the same underlying object in memory. This is a core mechanism for optimizing memory usage and performance.
    >>> const keyword usage: The const keyword must be used both when declaring the constructor and when creating an instance of the class using that constructor to leverage the benefits of constant objects.
    >>> Restrictions:
        # const constructors cannot have a body; all field initialization must occur in the initializer list.
        # The class must not have any non-final fields.
        # Fields in the initializer list must be initialized with other compile-time constants.
    >>> Usage: You use the const keyword both when defining the constructor and when creating an instance of the class to leverage the benefits of const objects.

  * static means this instance belongs to the class itself, not to individual objects of the class. There will only be one fordFocus instance shared by all potential users of the FordFocus class.

  * üîç Breakdown: Keyword/Part ---- Meaning
    # static ---- This variable belongs to the **class itself**, not to individual objects. You can access it as 'FordFocus.fordFocus' without creating an instance.
    # 'const' ----- Makes the object **immutable and created at compile time**. It's more efficient and ensures the object cannot be changed.
    # 'FordFocus' ----- The **type** of the variable ‚Äî an instance of the 'FordFocus' class.
    # 'fordFocus' ------- The **name** of the variable. You can use it elsewhere like 'FordFocus.fordFocus.model'.
    # 'FordFocus("Ford", "Focus", "2013", true)' ------- This calls the **const constructor** of the 'FordFocus' class to create a new object with these values:
        ‚Ä¢ 'make'     : '"Ford"'
        ‚Ä¢ 'model'    : '"Focus"'
        ‚Ä¢ 'yearMade' : '"2013"'

/*
  * Benefits:
    # Performance: Canonicalization reduces memory consumption and improves performance by avoiding redundant object creation.
    # Readability: Clearly indicates that an object is immutable and its values are fixed at compile time.
    # Efficiency: Useful for creating widgets in Flutter, where constant widgets can be optimized during the build process.
