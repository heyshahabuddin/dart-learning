/*
  * In Dart, a constructor is a special method used to create and initialize instances of a class. It is automatically invoked when an object of the class is created. Constructors are essential for setting up the initial state of an object and ensuring it's ready for use.

  * Generative Constructors: These are the most common type, used to create new instances and initialize instance variables. Generative constructors can be either:
      # Unnamed Constructor
      # Parameterized Constructor
      # Named Constructor: In Dart, a named constructor provides a way to define multiple constructors within a single class, allowing for different ways to instantiate an object. Unlike the default (unnamed) constructor, which can only exist once per class, named constructors have distinct names, making them more descriptive and enhancing code readability.

  * Named Constructor: Named constructors are unique to Dart. They allow a class to have multiple constructors, each identified by a different name. Named constructors are created by defining a constructor with the class name followed by the constructor name.
  Other languages support multiple constructor but dart don't support it. Dart have a unique feature named constructor.

  * Key characteristics of named constructors:
    >> Syntax: They are defined by using the class name followed by a dot and a unique name, for example: ClassName.constructorName().
    >> Multiple Constructors: They enable a class to have more than one constructor, each potentially taking different parameters and performing specific initialization logic.
    >> Clarity and Readability: Named constructors improve code clarity by explicitly stating the purpose or method of object creation. This is particularly useful when a class can be initialized in various distinct ways.
    >> Flexibility in Initialization: They allow for diverse initialization scenarios, such as creating objects with default values, from specific data sources, or with predefined configurations.
    >> No Inheritance: Subclasses do not inherit named constructors from their superclasses. If a subclass requires a named constructor from its superclass, it must explicitly implement it.
    >> In Dart, a named constructor is a custom constructor within a class that is given a specific name, allowing you to create objects using different initialization logic or parameter sets apart from the default constructor. Named constructors provide a way to add multiple ways of creating objects with varying configurations.
    >> Named constructors are beneficial when you want to provide alternative ways of constructing objects, which can be particularly useful for handling different input formats, conversions, or special initialization scenarios. They allow for more expressive and meaningful object creation in your Dart code.
    >> Providing clarity on their purpose (e.g., ClassName.fromMap()) and each with a distinct name.
    >> The syntax is given below: className.ConstructorName(param_list){
                                       // Body of Constructor
                                    }
