/*
  * Whatâ€™s Happening Here?
    # Private Variable _balance:
      >> Can only be accessed inside the BankAccount class.
      >> No one outside the class can directly modify _balance.
    #Public Getter (balance):
      >> Provides read-only access to the balance.
      >> People can see the balance but cannot change it directly.
    # Public Methods (deposit and withdraw):
      >> Control how money is deposited or withdrawn.
      >> Protect against invalid or unauthorized actions (e.g., negative deposits or over-withdrawing).
  * Key Points:
    >> Private Members: Use _ to make a variable private.
    >> Getter and Setter: Control access to private data with getter and setter methods.
    >> Encapsulation Protects Data: Users interact with your class safely, without breaking the logic.
